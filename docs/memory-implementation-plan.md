# Memory implementation and activation gates

Date: 2026-09-30. Adrian authorizes implementation of the reviewed memory design now. This authorization changes the earlier implementation sequence. Hook parity remains a separate completion gate. Memory ownership and remote sharing require their acceptance evidence before activation.

## Work sequence

1. Build synthetic native fixtures and record the installed read, write, review, and context paths.
2. Implement governed native operations, stable references, truthful receipts, corrections, forgetting, and concurrent-write protection.
3. Integrate the Hermes provider and native hooks with one authenticated context policy for all messaging apps.
4. Implement optional MCP access with credential-bound grants, restricted enrollment, and active-session revocation.
5. Add the preferences page, health checks, review controls, and recoverable ownership configuration.
6. Test fresh installation, lifecycle, backup, restore, update, and failure behavior. Run the existing plugin release tests and independent review.

Native LifeOS files remain the authoritative facts. Integration metadata must not become a second editable fact store. Hooks retain automatic recall and review. Hermes retains history, compression, and skill learning.

## Current status

Implementation started on `feature/lifeos-memory`. No running memory ownership switch or remote sharing activation has occurred. Test data is synthetic. The existing `.211` and `.213` installations remain unchanged.

## Required evidence

- Native remember, recall, correction, forgetting, rejected writes, and request retries.
- Safe interleaving of native reviewers and explicit clients, including stale corrections and interrupted publication.
- Allowed and denied markers in actual model inputs under the common messaging policy.
- Provider discovery and tools with both built-in lasting stores disabled, without duplicate extraction or lost skill learning.
- Optional MCP grants, denied operations, revocation, and shared access to the same native record.
- Separate profile roots, session lifecycle, child and scheduled contexts, schema checks, backup, restore, updates, and configuration rollback.

Each result must identify the fixture, source revision, command, expected result, actual result, and limits. Missing adapter metadata retains restricted access. Representative adapter tests do not establish support for untested adapters.
